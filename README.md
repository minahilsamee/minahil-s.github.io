# Hi there, I’m Minahil B. Samee, P.E. 👋

I’m a licensed **Mechanical Engineer (Texas P.E.)** with a background in **building systems, HVAC design, and STEM education**. My work lives at the intersection of **engineering, problem-solving, and mentoring**, and I enjoy turning messy requirements into practical, human-centered designs. This GitHub portfolio is where I document my journey into more **data-driven engineering and analytics**, especially around energy use and building performance.

## 🔧 Experience

### Mechanical Design Engineer, P.E. — Jones\*DBR / Jones Engineers L.P. (Houston, TX)  
*2017 – 2022*

- Designed HVAC and building systems for commercial and educational facilities, from **load calculations and code research** to **Revit-based layouts** and **COMcheck/ASHRAE 55 compliance studies**.  
- Coordinated with architects, clients, and vendors; reviewed submittals/RFIs and clarified sequences of operation to reduce ambiguity and rework.  
- Improved data handling by structuring design information in Excel, reducing manual processing time and helping junior engineers ramp up faster.

### Electrical Designer / Graduate Engineer — Jones\*DBR  

- Supported multidisciplinary MEP projects and communicated schedule risks clearly to clients.  
- Conducted site investigations and delegated field tasks efficiently to optimize time on site.

### Instructional Support Engineer — Appropriate Development Technology  

- Developed hands-on **STEM activities** using 3D printing, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi for students aged 9–13.  
- Helped align projects with education-focused missions and contributed to grant proposals.

### Research & Internships  

- **Undergraduate Research Assistant (PURS):** Simulated 2D→3D blood flow using ANSYS Fluent and presented findings on chaotic flow and cardiovascular physiology.  
- **Construction Engineer Intern, Houston Airport System:** Assisted with data mining, design changes, and schedule review for major airfield projects.  
- **Engineering Intern, Packages Limited (Pakistan):** Identified process improvements that reduced manual labor with minimal additional cost.

## 📂 Selected Projects

- **Optimization of Race Track Trajectories**  
  Undergraduate honors thesis optimizing lap time for a race track using numerical methods and simulation; recognized as an **Outstanding Thesis**.

- **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Prototype**  
  Co-designed and built a fast UAV (~50 mph, \<30 s lap time) and coordinated technical documentation across multiple senior design teams.

- **Water-Propelled Apparatus**  
  Designed a wheeled platform and hydraulic system to maximize thrust and sensitivity, achieving a ~10× change in motion via nozzle and geometry tuning.

- **Ball Sorter/Launcher System**  
  Designed and fabricated a ball-sorting and launching device recognized among the top teams for innovative fluid-system integration and reduced actuation force.

- **HVAC & Energy Design Portfolio**  
  Collection of HVAC system designs, load calculations, and compliance checks (Revit, TRACE 700, COMcheck, ASHRAE 55) for educational and commercial buildings. On GitHub, I’m beginning to translate similar workflows into **reproducible notebooks** and small **data-science experiments** focused on building performance.
